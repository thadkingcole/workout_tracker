# Contributing Guidelines

Any and all contributions are most welcome! To ensure the smoothest contribution experience possible, please refer to the following sections for the situation that best applies.

- [Bug](#if-you-find-a-bug)
- [New Feature](#if-you-want-a-new-feature)
- [Pull Requests](#if-your-code-is-ready-for-review)
- [Questions](#i-have-a-question-on-how-to-use-the-app)
- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)

## If you find a bug

Awesome! First look at the issues to see if the bug has already been identified. If not, create an issue using the "Bug report" template.

If the bug is unassigned, you may assign it to yourself and begin coding if you would like to try to fix the bug. If the bug is already assigned, touch base with that developer prior to beginning to code.

## If you want a new feature

Splendid! First, look at the issues to see if the feature is already being considered. If not, create an issue using the "Feature request" template and assign it to [thadkingcole](https://github.com/thadkingcole). Once assigned, I will reach out to you to discuss the feature and its efficacy, so be sure to include your contact info in the submitted issue.

You may begin to code if the feature is simple enough to implement, but keep it mind the feature may not be desired by all parties.
